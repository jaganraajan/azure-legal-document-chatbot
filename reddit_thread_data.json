      "body": "Hey guys, I called IRCC last week and got some info on PR cards. \n\nFigured I would put it here in case it‚Äôs helpful for someone else. \n\nAll 1st PR cards (i.e. you‚Äôre getting your first card rather than renewing it) are considered urgent. Therefore, submitting a web form or something of that sort won‚Äôt speed up your process.\n\nOnce you are PR, your PR portal won‚Äôt be updated. So even if your address and photo are still ‚ÄúUnder review with IRCC‚Äù, they are processing your PR card.\n\nIf you want real time updates, then you can link your application using GCkey. Click on link application, add your UCI and it should work.\n\nYou absolutely need your PR card to travel back to Canada, if you‚Äôre traveling by plane. If you don‚Äôt have it, then you must apply for a PRTD outside of Canada. \n\nYou can enter by private vehicle to Canada through the US border using your eCoPR and another piece of identity. \n\nI got eCoPR on the 19th of March and still waiting ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs frustrating but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else we can do besides waiting.",

      "body": "Delays in PR Card Issuance After eCoPR ‚Äì Ongoing Technical Issue in Sydney?\n\nHi everyone,\nI‚Äôm currently waiting for my first PR card after receiving my eCoPR on March 25, 2025. I‚Äôve contacted IRCC multiple times as the current processing time listed on their website has been exceeded.\n\nToday, the agent told me there‚Äôs a technical issue affecting many files processed at the Sydney office, which is preventing the cards from being printed. It seems I‚Äôm not alone‚Äîapparently, many applicants are stuck in the same situation.\n\nAccording to the agent, it‚Äôs important to contact IRCC directly so they can flag your file and initiate a follow-up with the Sydney office. This might help prevent your application from falling through the cracks.\n\nShe told me that, with the follow-up, I should expect to receive the card in 2 to 3 more business weeks, assuming things get back on track.\n\nJust wanted to share in case others are experiencing this. Has anyone else heard the same thing or been impacted by this delay? Any updates from your side?",

      "body": "Is there any way we can reach out as a group to Rachel Bendayan (Minister of IRCC) or press to report this? This is extremely ridiculous that IRCC has left us all in a limbo, especially those who are/were supposed to travel. Thousands of dollars are at stake for those who made travel plans trusting IRCC. The 'average processing time of PR cards' is clearly a false information at this point. The IRCC agents in call center just give the same useless information. Anyone has any idea how to reach out and report this to someone authoritative including the press?  \nTIA.",
